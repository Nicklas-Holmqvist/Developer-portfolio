# Portfolio 1.0
Laboration 2 - Javascript homework

## Description
This is my portfolio and CV.

I have used html, css and javascript to make this portfolio as clean as I wanted for the time being.

The big thing with the page is that there is an automatic changing day- and darkmode.
On the day you wanna have a bright page because it is bright outside.
And when the evening hits, it is turning to a dark theme.

The solution was to have a function with an if that changed between two other collection function on the date function.
setInterval is running every minute to check for the time and outchange. 
You may say that I didn´t have to go so far because you maby just visit once and doesn't have the page up.
But I like that so! :)

This function could have been much more smoother if I didn´t have so many specific elements and colors.
The more goodies, the more time it takes.

I would love to make it easier and much cleaner in the future!
